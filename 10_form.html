        Pokhara: 
         Imagine a place with a beautiful, big lake surrounded by tall, green mountains. 
         In Pokhara, you can go on a boat ride in the lake and even see the reflection of the mountains in the water!
         It's like a magical fairy tale world.

        Mahendranagar: 
         This is a place where you can see lots of trees and colorful flowers.
         It's like a big garden! People there have their own special ways of living and they might even have some special stories to tell you.
        
        Dhangadi:
         Dhangadi is a bit different from other places.
         It's warm and you might feel like you're in a jungle because there are lots of animals and plants around. 
         You can learn about nature and maybe even spot some unique animals!
