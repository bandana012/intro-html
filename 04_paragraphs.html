    <h2>Headings and Paragraphs</h2>
    <h3>This is a Heading and Paragraphs</h3>

    <p> HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is like the blueprint for building web pages on the internet. 
        Imagine a web page as a digital puzzle made up of different pieces. 
        HTML is the tool we use to put those pieces together in the right order so that everyone can see and interact with the webpage.

        Just like how a recipe tells you what ingredients to use and how to mix them to bake a delicious cake, 
        HTML tells a web browser (the software you use to access the internet) how to display the different elements of a web page. 
        hese elements can include headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and more. So, when you open a web page,
        it's like the browser follows the instructions in the HTML code and arranges everything to make the page look and work the way it should..</p>
