     Have you ever wondered how websites are created? 
     Well, the magic behind websites is called "HTML," which stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
     HTML is like the building blocks that help us create the content of webpages.
     Think of a webpage as a digital book.
     Just like a book has chapters, pictures, and text, a webpage has headings, images, and paragraphs. 
     HTML helps us organize and structure all these elements on a webpage.
